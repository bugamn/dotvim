My personal VIm configuration, with plugins that I find useful to my needs.

To the moment, I use:

* latex-suite (with some modifications to avoid problems with latin characters) - might cut this one off.
* NERDTree
* NERDCommenter
* tasklist
* gnupg
* snipMate
* python updated syntax file
* tagbar
* LanguageTool
